ABSTRACT 
A giant superstore has worldwide operations. 
It operates across the globe and deals with all the major product categories - consumer, corporate & home office.
In this analysis, a forecasting model is developed using machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of forecasts of sales.
The proposed model is especially targeted to support the future purchase and more accurate forecasts product sales and A model based 
on a superstore's data is developed in order to validate the use of the various machine learning algorithms. 
In the case study, multiple regression methods are compared best model is chosen the store caters to 7 different market segments
